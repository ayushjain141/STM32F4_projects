### STM32F4 custom device driver libs and test-case Examples (CE):<br>

The repo contains custom device driver libraries for STM32F4 series MCU and test-case examples developed using the same libs.

The repo has following test case examples(s) - <br>

- blinky_app_stm32f407
- uart_test_stm32f407
- uart_rx_interrupt_test_stm32f407
- uart_printf_test_stm32f4
- arm_cortex_m4_assembly_test

<br>
Note: The libs can be added to applications using the makefile like build system or an IDE for Embedded software. In this repo, most of the apps have been developed using Keil IDE, and it's project environment configured for STM32F4 MCU.
