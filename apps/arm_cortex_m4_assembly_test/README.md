### Test Case Example(CE):<br>
# ARM cortex M4 assembly test on STM32F407

The CE contains a test assembly code which has several instructions and directives used in it. The code has few instructions for purpose of testing only. Instructions related to **function calls** and **stack operations** are also tested in the example. The source code is in the file _asm_test.s_. The **project references** are mentioned in the source file at it's end in the section `Refererences`.

Upon step-by-step debugging of the running code in STM32, we can observe the states of CPU registers.

The CE assumes the configuration of memory regions RAM and ROM for vector table placement is done by the user. It can be done through either Linker script or the IDE's settings like `"options for target..."` in Keil IDE.

The memory configuration (ROM , RAM) used in this example is as shown below. Keil IDEs `"options for target..."` was used for the same.
