### Code Example(CE):<br>
# Blinky app for STM32F407

The CE demostrates GPIO peripheral example, here an led is toggled with a delay period which is controlled by a user button input.

NOTE: The system core clock is configured to use PLL at 100MHz, this is implemented in the file <i>\< application >\RTE\Device\STM32F407VETx\system_stm32f4xx.c</i> in the function `SystemInit()`, this file is a part of the application.

## Software Setup 
- Tested with Keil uvision4 IDE: V5.22.0.0 (MDK522)
    - Device pack for STM32F407 in keil: STM32F4xx_DFP Version 2.14.0 (2019-07-24)
- ArmÂ® Compiler V5.06

## Hardware setup
- <b>MCU used</b>: STM32F407
- <b>Development Board</b>: STM32 Black board with STM32F407VET6 onboard
- ST-Link utility HW for program code download to STM32 
- Signal analysis/probe tools like Saleae logic analyzer or oscilloscope

## Operation

1. Upon the start of application the user led at pin `GPIOA7` starts to toggle at frequency of `1 Hz`.

2. On pressing and holding the user button at pin `GPIOE4` the frequency of toggling changes to `20 Hz` and the led toggles at this frequency till the user-button is held pressed.

3. When the button is released, the frequency is restored to `1 Hz`.
