### Test Case Example(CE):<br>
# UART based printf test app for STM32F407

The CE demostrates UART peripheral example, in this example `printf()` is retargeted to work with <b>UART</b> peripheral. This is acheived by using <i>../libs/retarget_stdio</i> library.

NOTE: The system core clock is configured to use PLL at 100MHz, this is implemented in the file <i>\< application >\RTE\Device\STM32F407VETx\system_stm32f4xx.c</i> in the function `SystemInit()`, this file is a part of the application.

## Software(SW) Setup
- Tested with Keil uvision4 IDE: V5.22.0.0 (MDK522)
    - Device pack for STM32F407 in keil: STM32F4xx_DFP Version 2.14.0 (2019-07-24)
- ArmÂ® Compiler V5.06
- Serial Terminal PC Application - Tera Term Version 5.2

## Hardware(HW) setup
- <b>MCU used</b>: STM32F407
- <b>Development Board</b>: STM32 Black board with STM32F407VET6 onboard
- ST-Link utility HW for program code download to STM32 MCU
- USB to serial(UART) converter hardware Ex: CP2102, PL2303, FT232RL, Arduino board's serial converter HW can also be used.

## Operation

The `printf()` function from the C language's <i>stdio.h</i> is redirected to use UART peripheral by using <i>../libs/retarget_stdio</i> library. After the program runs the following output is observed on the screen, a hello world message an `int` and a `float` value get's printed.
```
----------------------------------------------
Hello World !!!   int = 141, float = 235.893240
----------------------------------------------
```
